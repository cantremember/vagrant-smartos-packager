========================

Create Vagrant boxes of the latest SmartOS platform image.

This repository includes scripts to help create SmartOS Vagrant
boxes. The box created will be a Vagrant-capable global zone,
into which local zones can be installed with a TBD vagrant plugin
for managing local zones.

## Dependencies

* VirtualBox

## Usage

Download the latest SmartOS platform image and turn it into
a VirtualBox VM.

```bash
./bin/mksmartvm
```

When the VM spins up in VirtualBox, use the default networking
options. Set the root password to be `vagrant`.

Now log in via ssh:

```bash
ssh localhost -p 2222 -l root
```

### Creating barebones global zone

```bash
curl -k https://raw.github.com/sax/vagrant-smartos-packager/master/bin/prepare_global_zone \
 | bash -s
```

This will install custom services that will load on boot, updating the
image to ensure that users will persist between reboots. By default,
everything except `/usbkey` and `/zones` and `/opt/custom` will reset
between boots, so we have to do some tweaking.

Now run the following:

```bash
curl -k https://raw.github.com/sax/vagrant-smartos-packager/master/bin/prepare_gz_users \
 | bash -s
```

This will create a vagrant user. By default Vagrant expects the vagrant
user and root to have the password set to `vagrant`.

### Creating global zone with image imported

If you are creating a box with an image already imported, instead of
the above instructions you can jump straight to:

```bash
curl -k https://raw.github.com/sax/vagrant-smartos-packager/master/bin/prepare_for_lz \
  | bash -s [image_uuid]
```

### Installing sudo

If sudo will be required in the global zone, run the following command:
```bash
curl -k https://raw.github.com/sax/vagrant-smartos-packager/master/bin/install_sudo \
 | bash -s
```

### Creating box

Now stop the VM, and run the following command to load it into Vagrant:

```bash
./bin/boxify
```

## Vagrant configurations

#### synced folders

The SmartOS global zone mounts / as a ramdisk with a size of 262M. When
using type `rsync`, to sync the local directory into the global zone,
ensure that it is very lightweight.

In order to use 'rsync' with a larger directory, you'll need to disable
the normal mountpoint and create a new one on a persisted disk.

```ruby
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/zones/vagrant", type: "rsync"
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", disabled: true
```

Synced folders of type `nfs` will work, pending a pull request on
Vagrant.
